# Multi-Class Image Classification Project

## Overview
This project focuses on performing comprehensive analysis and classification of a multi-class image dataset. The steps involved include data exploration, advanced feature extraction, machine learning model training, and optimization using ensemble methods.

## Key Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  - Conducted thorough EDA on the dataset.  
  - Analyzed class distributions and visualized sample images for better understanding.

- **Feature Extraction:**  
  - Implemented advanced methods such as:  
    - **Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)**  
    - **Color Histograms**  
  - Optimized inputs for machine learning models.

- **Model Training and Evaluation:**  
  - Trained and compared the performance of the following models:  
    - Naive Bayes  
    - Decision Tree  
    - Random Forest  
    - Perceptron  
  - Evaluated model performance using accuracy metrics.

- **Performance Optimization:**  
  - Enhanced classification results using advanced ensemble methods:  
    - **XGBoost**  
    - **LightGBM**

## Results
