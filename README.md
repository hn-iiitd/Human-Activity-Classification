Conducted thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a multi-class image dataset, including class distribution
analysis and visualization of sample images.
• Implemented advanced feature extraction methods such as Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and color histograms
to optimize model inputs.
• Trained and compared multiple machine learning models, including Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and
Perceptron, evaluating their performance using accuracy metrics.
• Enhanced model performance by implementing advanced ensemble methods, specifically XGBoost and LightGBM,
achieving superior classification results.
